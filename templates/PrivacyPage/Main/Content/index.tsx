        <h5>Information We Collect</h5>
        <p>
            Information we collect falls into one of two categories:
            “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected”
            information. “Voluntarily provided” information refers to any
            information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or
            participating in any of our services and promotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Automatically collected” information refers to any information
            automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our
            products and services.
        </p>
        <h5>Log Data</h5>
        <p>
            When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the
            standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your
            device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and
            version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the
            time spent on each page, and other details about your visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site,
            we may automatically collect data about the error and the
            circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include
            technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when
            the error happened, and other technical information relating to the
            problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in
            the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature
            of the error is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware that while this information may not be personally
            identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other
            data to personally identify individual persons.
